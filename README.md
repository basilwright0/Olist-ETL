# Olist E-Commerce ELT Pipeline

A production-shaped **ELT pipeline** built on the modern data stack:
**Airflow** orchestrates extraction and loading, **dbt** transforms raw data
into a tested dimensional model in **Postgres**, and **Metabase** serves the
analytics — all running locally with a single `docker compose up`.

The dataset is the [Olist Brazilian E-Commerce](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
public dataset (~100k orders across 9 related tables).

## Dashboard

A Metabase dashboard built on the `marts` schema, over the full 2016–2018 Olist
history (99,441 orders, R$16M GMV):

One highlight: average delivery time falls monotonically as review score rises
(1★ ≈ 21 days, 5★ ≈ 11 days) — delivery delay is the clearest driver of poor
reviews.

The dashboard is **reproducible from code**: `python scripts/setup_metabase.py`
provisions the Metabase data source, all six cards, and the layout via the REST
API (idempotent, standard library only). See the script header for config.

## What this project demonstrates

- **Orchestration** with Airflow: a scheduled, retrying DAG with idempotent,
  **per-day incremental loads** and historical **backfills**.
- **ELT modeling** with dbt: a layered `staging → intermediate → marts`
  project with a star schema, surrogate keys, an **incremental** fact model,
  and a **snapshot** (slowly-changing dimension).
- **Data quality** as a pipeline gate: dbt core tests (`not_null`, `unique`,
  `accepted_values`, `relationships`), **dbt-expectations** checks (value
  ranges, set membership, regex, distribution, row count), and a
  graded-severity singular test — all run inside the DAG via
  [Cosmos](https://www.astronomer.io/cosmos/) so each model/test is its own
  Airflow task.
- **Reproducibility**: fully containerized; clone, drop in the data, and run.
- **CI**: GitHub Actions runs `dbt deps`, `sqlfluff` lint, and `dbt compile`
  on every pull request.

## Quickstart

### 1. Get the data
Download the [Olist dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
and unzip the 9 CSVs into `data/raw/`. With the
[Kaggle CLI](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api):

```bash
kaggle datasets download -d olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce -p data/raw --unzip
```

You should end up with `data/raw/olist_orders_dataset.csv`, etc.

### 2. Start the stack

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

First build takes a few minutes. When it settles:

| Service | URL | Login |
|---|---|---|
| Airflow | http://localhost:8080 | `admin` / `admin` |
| Metabase | http://localhost:3000 | set up on first visit |
| Warehouse Postgres | `localhost:5434` | `warehouse` / `warehouse` |

### 3. Run the pipeline
The DAG is dated to the Olist history (2016–2018), so unpausing alone won't
load anything (`catchup` is off by design). Backfill a date range instead:

```bash
docker compose exec airflow-scheduler \
  airflow dags backfill olist_elt -s 2017-01-01 -e 2017-03-31
```

Each run loads that day's orders into `raw`, then Cosmos runs the dbt models
and tests. Browse the modeled tables in the `marts` schema, then point
Metabase at the warehouse (`host: warehouse, port: 5432, db: warehouse`).

## How it works

**Extract/Load** (`include/extract/load_olist.py`) lands the raw CSVs as text
in the `raw` schema. Reference tables are full-refreshed each run; orders and
order items are loaded **one logical day at a time** and deleted-then-inserted
per day, so re-running a date is safe (idempotent) and backfills compose
cleanly.

**Transform** (`include/dbt/`) is layered:
- `staging/` — one model per source; cast + rename only (1:1 with raw).
- `intermediate/` — ephemeral joins and business logic (delivery timing, item
  enrichment).
- `marts/` — the star schema.

### Data model (marts)

```
        dim_customers          dim_products   dim_sellers
              │                      │              │
              └──────────┐      ┌────┴───────┐      │
                         ▼      ▼            ▼      ▼
   dim_dates ───────►  fct_orders        fct_order_items  ◄─── (incremental)
                         ▲                                 fct_payments
                  dim_geography
```

- `fct_orders` — grain: one order; delivery, payment, and review measures.
- `fct_order_items` — grain: one line item; **incremental** on `order_date`.
- `dim_customers` — keyed on `customer_unique_id` (the real person), which is
  what enables repeat-purchase analysis — a detail most tutorials miss.

### Questions the marts answer
Delivery time vs. estimate by state · review-score drivers (delay
correlation) · GMV by category and region over time · seller on-time rate ·
repeat-customer rate.

## Data quality
Tests run as a pipeline gate — Cosmos `TestBehavior.AFTER_EACH` makes a failing
test stop the affected branch of the DAG. The suite (56 tests) combines:

- **dbt core**: `not_null`, `unique`, `relationships`, `accepted_values` on keys
  and categorical columns.
- **[dbt-expectations](https://github.com/metaplane/dbt-expectations)**: value
  ranges (price / freight / payment ≥ 0, delivery 0–365 days), set membership
  (`payment_type`, `order_status`), a regex on the 32-char hex `order_id`, a
  column uniqueness-proportion check, a table row-count check, and a
  distribution check (mean `review_score` stays ≈ 4).
- **Graded-severity singular test**: delivered orders should have a delivery
  date — it *warns* on the ~8 known Olist source anomalies and only *fails* the
  build if they exceed 20 (`error_if: '>20'`), treating a spike as a regression.

## Notes & troubleshooting
- **dbt runs in an isolated virtualenv** (`/opt/dbt-venv`) so its dependencies
  never clash with Airflow's. Cosmos points at it via `ExecutionConfig`.
- If the Airflow DAG shows an import error on first boot, give the
  `airflow-init` container a moment — it fetches dbt packages (`dbt deps`)
  into the mounted project so Cosmos can parse the graph.
- The warehouse is exposed on host port **5434** (5432 is used internally).
- Regenerate the published docs with `dbt docs generate --static` and copy
  `include/dbt/target/static_index.html` to `docs/index.html` (GitHub Pages
  serves `/docs`).

## Roadmap
- [x] Seed a Metabase dashboard and commit a screenshot to `docs/`.
- [x] Publish dbt docs (lineage + catalog) to GitHub Pages.
- [ ] Add Great Expectations or `dbt-expectations` for richer checks.
- [ ] Enrich with a live FX (BRL/USD) feed to show batch + incremental in one DAG.
